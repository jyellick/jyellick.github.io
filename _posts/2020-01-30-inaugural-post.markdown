Welcome to the inaugural post in what I hope will be a long and much loved series of posts about my development experiences, trials and tribulations, demos, explanations, and whatever else seems worthy of being posted for posterity.

The project which has sparked this blog, is the [MirBFT Consensus Library](https://github.com/IBM/mirbft), which, at the time of this writing is nothing but a skeleton and shell.

I've put together a small PoC proving out the green path at [my fork](https://github.com/jyellick/mirbft), which is woefully incomplete (once again, at the time of this writing), but will hopefully mature rapidly over the coming weeks and months.

Some topics which I hope to post on in the near future:
* A basic introduction to consensus and fault tolerance.
* A basic overview of PBFT.
* A very high level overview of how MirBFT differs.

And in the future:
* If I'm very ambitious a live demo, or more likely some screenshots and instructions for performing your own live demo of the code.
* As interesting design decisions occur, I hope to document them, and if they don't work out, perhaps to update them with exactly why they did not.

For now, this post is just to initially populate the Github Pages site, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  Hope to be back with more content soon.
