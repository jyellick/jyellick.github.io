My name is Jason Yellick, and I'm a software developer.  Currently I work for IBM, and much of my time is spent as a maintainer working on the open source [Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric) project.

Topics which are near and dear to my heart, include blockchain, consensus algorithms, distributed systems, golang, and any other emerging technologies that help me solve problems.

I hope to expand this about section at some point when there's more content to be had, but for now, the idea behind this blog is to document my thoughts and decisions, as I work to implement a generic BFT consensus library [MirBFT](https://github.com/IBM/mirbft).
